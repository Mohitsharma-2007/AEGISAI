# AEGIS-AI Script Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive set of attack simulation scripts for the AEGIS-AI platform. These scripts are now located directly in the `backend/scripts` directory and are accessible from the frontend through the script bridge.

## Implemented Scripts

### DDoS Attacks
- **Slowloris Attack** (`slowloris_attack.py`): Simulates a Slowloris attack that keeps connections open by sending partial HTTP requests

### Web Attacks
- **XSS Payload Demo** (`xss_payload_demo.py`): Demonstrates Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks with various payloads
- **CSRF Attack Demo** (`csrf_attack_demo.py`): Demonstrates Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against web forms
- **Form Submitter** (`form_submitter.py`): Simulates automated form submission attacks
- **Harmful Demo** (`harmful_demo.py`): Demonstrates harmful Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks

### Reconnaissance
- **Port Scanner** (`port_scanner.py`): Scans for open ports on a target system
- **Directory Bruteforce** (`directory_bruteforce.py`): Attempts to discover hidden directories on a web server

### AI/LLM Attacks
- **AI Chatbot Demo** (`ai_chatbot_demo.py`): Demonstrates attacks against AI chatbots
- **LangChain Agent Demo** (`langchain_demo.py`): Demonstrates attacks against LangChain agents
- **OpenAI API Demo** (`openai_api_demo.py`): Demonstrates attacks against OpenAI APIs
- **Anthropic Claude Demo** (`anthropic_claude_demo.py`): Demonstrates attacks against Anthropic Claude
- **Microsoft AutoGen Demo** (`autogen_demo.py`): Demonstrates attacks against Microsoft AutoGen

### Bot Attacks
- **Fake Login Bot** (`fake_login_bot.py`): Simulates automated login attempts with credential stuffing
- **Email Spam Demo** (`email_spam_demo.py`): Demonstrates email spam attacks
- **Brute Force Demo** (`brute_force_demo.py`): Demonstrates brute force password attacks
- **Web Scraper Demo** (`scraper_demo.py`): Demonstrates web scraping attacks
- **Selenium Bot Demo** (`selenium_bot_demo.py`): Demonstrates browser automation attacks

### CAPTCHA Attacks
- **CAPTCHA Bypass Demo** (`captcha_bypass_demo.py`): Shows techniques to bypass CAPTCHA using third-party services
- **CAPTCHA Solver Demo** (`captcha_solver_demo.py`): Demonstrates automated CAPTCHA solving

## Script Structure

Each script follows a consistent structure:

1. **Metadata**: Name and description
2. **Run Function**: Simulates the attack and returns events and block details
3. **Test Detection Function**: Simulates the detection process with realistic timing

Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script Name
This script demonstrates...
"""

import random
import time
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional

# Script metadata
NAME = "Script Name"
DESCRIPTION = "Description of the script"

def run(**kwargs):
    """Run the script"""
    # Implementation...
    return {
        "success": True,
        "events": events,
        "block_details": block_details,
        "script": NAME
    }

def test_detection():
    """Test the detection speed of the script"""
    # Simulate detection
    time.sleep(0.002)  # 2ms
    
    # Return the result
    return {
        "success": True,
        "detection_time": 2.0,
        "script": NAME
    }
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend uses the script bridge (`frontend/js/script-bridge.js`) to communicate with the backend scripts. The script bridge has been updated to use the correct file paths:

```javascript
// Map of script files to their Python module paths
const SCRIPT_PATHS = {
  'slowloris_attack': 'scripts.slowloris_attack',
  'xss_payload_demo': 'scripts.xss_payload_demo',
  'csrf_attack_demo': 'scripts.csrf_attack_demo',
  // ... and many more
};
```

## Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Simplified Structure**: All scripts are now in a single directory, making them easier to manage
2. **Consistent Implementation**: All scripts follow the same structure and API
3. **Realistic Simulation**: Each script simulates a realistic attack scenario with appropriate parameters
4. **Performance Measurement**: The test_detection function allows measuring the detection speed

## Next Steps

To further improve the script implementation:

1. Add more sophisticated attack simulations
2. Implement more realistic detection algorithms
3. Add support for script parameters to customize the attack behavior
4. Create a script discovery mechanism to automatically find and load scripts
